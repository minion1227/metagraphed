# Architecture Decision Records

Why metagraphed is built the way it is. Each ADR captures one significant
decision — its context, the choice made, and the consequences — so the reasoning
survives even when the code moves on. Skim these before proposing a structural
change.

| ADR                                         | Decision                                                                                                                | Status                                                                                                           |

## Keeping these current

ADRs are **immutable records of a decision at a point in time** — don't rewrite an
accepted one when reality moves. Instead:

- **A decision is replaced** → write a new ADR and set the old one's status to
  _Superseded by ADR-NNNN_ (see 0001 → 0007).
- **A decision lands or stalls** → update only its **Status** line, and the row
  above, so this index reflects reality at a glance.

New ADR: copy the header shape (Title · Status · Date · Context · Decision ·
Consequences), take the next number, and add a row here.
