# ADR 0009 — Autonomous contributor review gate (the Gittensory Gate)

- **Status:** Accepted — in use.
- **Date:** 2026-06-22
- **Relates to:** ADR 0008 (the one-file-per-subnet model the gate validates).
- **Updated by:** [ADR 0011](0011-retire-submission-preflight.md) — the residual
  metagraphed-side preflight was retired, making "pre-gates nothing" literal.

## Context

The contributor flywheel produces a steady stream of data PRs (new surfaces for
subnets). A maintainer cannot review each one, and a human pre-gate would be the
very bottleneck the flywheel exists to remove. The decision is **how a contributor
PR gets merged without a human in the loop — safely.**

## Decision

Contributor data PRs are adjudicated by an **external AI review gate** (Gittensory,
a separate repo + GitHub App) that is the **sole adjudicator** — the maintainer is
**not** in the loop before or after merge. metagraphed itself **pre-gates nothing**
(its CI emits advisory flags only; trust/provenance is display-only). The
disposition is deterministic at the edges and conservative in the middle:

- **Auto-CLOSE** on a deterministic fail — duplicate, dead/private `source_url`, a
  secret, a clear reviewer reject, or red CI.
- **Auto-MERGE** only when content is verified (owner-matched, fresh) with **both
  AI reviewers ≥ 0.9**, CI green, and mergeable-clean.
- **Hold for a human** only when genuinely uncertain.

A linked issue is **optional** — its absence is never a close reason; when one
exists the gate verifies the PR against the issue's intent.

The default posture is **close-when-in-doubt**: a redundant or unprovable PR costs
the contributor a re-submission, not the registry its integrity.

## Consequences

- **Throughput without a maintainer bottleneck** — the flywheel scales; recovery
  from an auto-close is a fresh PR, not a negotiation.
- **The gate is the contract.** Contributors (and AI tools) must get a PR _right
  before pushing_ — one focused subnet file (ADR 0008), and a public `url` plus an
  independent `source_url` that proves it. See [`CONTRIBUTING.md`](../../CONTRIBUTING.md)
  and the `metagraphed` skill for the checklist.
- **metagraphed stays adjudication-free** — no manual pre-escalation, no stored
  trust gating; the gate lives outside this repo and is configured there.
- **Trade-off:** an external adjudicator is a dependency, and a wrong auto-close is
  possible — accepted because the cost is a re-submit and the default protects the
  registry over any single contribution.
